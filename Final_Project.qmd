```{r packages-read}

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
# reading in basic packages


# read in data sets
```



You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
